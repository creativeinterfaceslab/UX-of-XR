# UDXR Tutorials

**This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for AR, VR, and XR development, showcasing fundamental configurations, device integrations, and interactive content creation in Unity and web-based frameworks.**

## What’s Covered (In 3 Points)

1. **Fundamental AR & VR Setup:**  
   Learn how to set up AR (using Vuforia) and VR projects (Meta/Oculus integration) in Unity, configure basic scenes, and create interactive environments.

2. **Interaction and Manipulation:**  
   Dive deeper into object interactions in both AR and VR scenarios, including manipulating 3D objects, creating drawing experiences with stylus inputs (MX Ink), integrating unconventional input devices (Makey Makey), and utilizing advanced hand-tracking solutions (UltraLeap).

3. **Web-Based 3D & VR (A-Frame):**  
   Explore the creation of immersive, interactive 3D and VR experiences directly in the browser with A-Frame, featuring step-by-step guides, simple games, and interactive demos.

## Tutorials Overview

### AR Tutorials (Unity & Vuforia)
- **Unity Vuforia Configurations (AR):**  
  Initial setup for AR development in Unity using Vuforia.  
  Learn to create AR scenes, configure image targets, and run AR apps on mobile devices.

- **AR Object Interactions:**  
  Enhance AR experiences by allowing objects to interact with each other and with user input, creating more dynamic and engaging augmented environments.

### VR Tutorials (Unity)
- **Unity VR Configuration:**  
  Set up your Unity environment for VR development. Understand the XR plugin management, device compatibility, and start building VR scenes for Meta Quest headsets.

- **VR Object Interactions and Manipulation:**  
  Implement picking, grabbing, and manipulating 3D objects in virtual space. Learn best practices for intuitive user experiences and naturalistic VR interactions.

### Device Integrations
- **MX Ink Stylus Integration (Meta Quest & Unity):**  
  Pair and configure the Logitech MX Ink stylus with your Meta Quest headset. Implement stylus-driven drawing, line rendering, and pressure-sensitive interactions within VR environments.

- **Makey Makey Configuration (Unity):**  
  Integrate the Makey Makey input device to control objects within Unity scenes. Map conductive materials to arrow keys and create unique physical-to-digital interactions.

- **UltraLeap Hand Tracking (Unity):**  
  Set up the UltraLeap (Leap Motion) controller in Unity to enable precise hand tracking. Implement natural hand gestures like grabbing, throwing, and interacting with virtual objects without controllers.

### A-Frame (Web-Based 3D & VR)
- **A-Frame Beginner’s Guide & Projects:**  
  Understand what A-Frame is and how to create 3D, VR experiences directly in a web browser. Build an interactive environment and a simple “Collect the Orbs” game, all using HTML-like tags and simple JavaScript.
